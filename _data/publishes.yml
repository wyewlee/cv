- award: A Comparative Study on Medical Image Watermarking Using Hybrid Approach and RivaGAN
  organization: The 2nd International Conference on Digital Transformation and Applications (ICDXA 2021)
  year: 2021
  summary: Published a conference paper on the image processing field under the guidance of Dr Tan Chi Wee. The paper focused on invisible watermarking for medical image watermarking by exploring and comparing the implementation of hybrid approaches such as DWT, DWT-DCT, DWT-DCT-SVD and deep learning based approach of RivaGAN. Encoding of invisible watermarks were compared using PSNR and NCC and multiple transmission platforms were tested. Received good reviews and comments from reviewers. <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356493181_A_COMPARATIVE_STUDY_ON_MEDICAL_IMAGE_WATERMARKING_USING_HYBRID_APPROACH_AND_RIVAGAN'>[LINK]</a>
